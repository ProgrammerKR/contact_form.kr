# Contact Form | CodeHub

## Description
This project provides a responsive contact form page with a clean, modern design. The form allows users to submit their name, email, subject, and message. It includes client-side validation to ensure all fields are filled out correctly before submission.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The form is designed to look great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Validation**: Client-side validation checks for empty fields and valid email format.
- **User Feedback**: Error messages are displayed next to invalid fields, and a success message is shown upon successful submission.

## Installation
To use this contact form:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the form in action.

## Usage
- **Name Field**: Enter your full name.
- **Email Field**: Enter a valid email address.
- **Subject Field**: Enter the subject of your message.
- **Message Field**: Enter your message.

Upon submission, the form will validate the inputs. Errors will be displayed if the inputs are invalid, and a success message will appear if all fields are correct.

## Customization
